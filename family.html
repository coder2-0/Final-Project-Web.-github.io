    <h1>FAMILY</h1>
    <img class="image" src="family.jpeg">
    <p>A joint family is a distinctive and traditional social structure that has long been a fundamental component of numerous global civilizations. A combined family consists of many generations living under one roof, sharing experiences, responsibilities, pleasures, and sorrows. I am lucky enough to live in a joint family and get love not just from my parents but also from my uncle, aunt, and grandparents.</p>
