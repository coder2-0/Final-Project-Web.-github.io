            <tr>
                <td>Operators</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Control Flow (Conditional Statements)</td>
                <td>Conditional statements like if, else if, and else are used to make decisions in code based on certain conditions.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Loops</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Functions</td>

                <td>Arrays</td>
                <td>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Elements in an array can be accessed using their index.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Objects</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Events</td>
                <td>JavaScript can respond to events, such as user actions or changes in the document. Event listeners are used to handle these events.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>DOM Manipulation</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Asynchronous JavaScript</td>
                <td>JavaScript is asynchronous, allowing operations like fetching data or handling user input without blocking the execution of other code. Promises and async/await are commonly used.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Closures</td>
                <td>Closures allow functions to remember and access variables from their outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Prototypes and Inheritance</td>
                <td> JavaScript is prototype-based. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through prototypes.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):</td>
                <td>AJAX is a technique used to make asynchronous requests to a server without reloading the entire page. It's often used to fetch or send data.</td>

                <td>ES6+ Features:</td>
                <td>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and later versions introduce new features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, classes, and modules.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>Error Handling (try, catch):</td>
                <td>JavaScript provides error-handling mechanisms using try, catch, finally blocks to gracefully handle runtime errors.</td>
